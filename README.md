## This is an internal project to automate some of my actual time during work.

Basically, it utilizes Google Sheets URL, transforms into a .csv file, checks out due date, set a reminder date and decides whether or not to send a reminder.
It can also be deployed by any moment and you can only manage data manually on the google sheets file.

Tools used:
* Python-dotenv (for sensitive variables)
* Pandas & Numpy (to deal with dataframes maipulation) and
* Python's SMTPlib
